# Xane üìà

**Xane** (IPA: /Ààhane/) is a **zero knowledge order book decentralized exchange**.

> Currently, only creating your own token is live. <br>
> It allows you to deploy your own token contract via your browser.

**Xane** is live at [xane.pages.dev/tools](https://xane.pages.dev/tools).

## Prerequirements
You need [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) knowledge for smart contract development. 
<br>
You need [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) knowledge for user interface development.
<br>
You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) knowledge for backend development.
<br>
You also need [zkApps](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps) knowledge to have a general understanding of zkApps.

## Setup A Development Environment
The easiest way to setup a development environment is to use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). <br>
You just need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed to use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). <br>
When you open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it will warn you to repeon it in a container. <br>
It also contains six different [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions that will help you during the development.

If you prefer a more traditional way to setup a development environment, you only need to install the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).




## Project Structure
This repository is a monorepo for the smart contracts, the user interface, and the backend of **Xane**. 



## Smart Contracts
It currently contains both `Token` contract, and `Exchange` contract (which is not complete).

`Token` contract is a simple token standard.

`Exchange` contract is an order book based exchange (which is not complete).

Smart contracts of **Xane** reside in [`contracts/`](https://github.com/BerzanXYZ/xane/tree/main/contracts) folder.
<br>
So you have to change the current working directory before working with them.
```sh
cd contracts/
```

You can run all the tests by running the command below.
```sh
npm run test
```

You can also run a specific test by running the command below.
```sh
npm run test -- Token # or <TEST_NAME>
```


## User Interface
The user interface of **Xane** is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

It resides in [`ui/`](https://github.com/BerzanXYZ/xane/tree/main/ui) folder.
<br>
So you have to change the current working directory before working with it.
```sh
cd ui/
```

You can start a development server by running the command below. 

```sh
npm run dev #  then visit localhost:5173 too see the preview
```


## Backend
The backend of **Xane** is built using [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

It resides in [`backend/`](https://github.com/BerzanXYZ/xane/tree/main/backend) folder.
<br>
So you have to change the current working directory before working with them.
```sh
cd backend/
```

You can build the backend by running the command below.
```sh
cargo build # --release for production
```
